Welcome to the Chatbot Project! This project aims to create a chatbot application using Flask and SQLAlchemy, allowing users to interact with the chatbot and perform various actions such as chatting, and accessing an admin interface.


Features
Chatbot Interaction: Users can chat with the chatbot and receive responses based on predefined patterns and responses.
Admin Interface: Administrators can access an interface to manage unresolved queries, add responses, and view chat history.
Export Chat History: Both users and administrators can export chat history to a CSV file for analysis and follow-up.
